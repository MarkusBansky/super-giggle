Universal application used to make super many requests to some urls and get a nice giggle at them.

## Idea

The main idea behind this application is to automate the requesting system for
most people to make it easier to combine our power into a single light spear.

How does it work?

1. You launch an application and get familiar with the basic navigation features.
2. Allow application to access required features of your machine.
3. Enter a list of awesome website you would like to explore with this app.
4. Hit the **Update & Run** button to start exploring!

Looks pretty simple, doesn't it?

## Compatability

This application is developer using `react-native` and it requires you 
to have a valid `vpn` subscription to work. All the rest is basically automated.

This application is able to run on any platform: Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS.

## Installation

In order to install the application, download the relevant distribution from the
latest **release** in the **releases** page.

## Usage

Presumably, you should have the app installed locally, and launched,
providing with all relevant rights to access VPN configurations, etc.
